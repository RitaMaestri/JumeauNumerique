	\title{Ground controllers interview}
	\maketitle
	Here is a set of questions to ask to ground controllers:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item General information:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Age, gender, educational background.
			
			\item For how many years are you working at Roissy-CDG? Did you work on other airports? Is there any distinctive feature at Roissy-CDG? 
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Ground controller's practices:    
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Do you think you can distinguish between phases of high workload and low workload in your job? (This is a comfort question that will be eventually reformulated as an affirmation)
			\item Can you think of some complex traffic situations that can cause high workload, independently form the sector you are working in?        	
			\item How does the complexity of the traffic change based on which sector your are handling? (Sectors: whole airport, north, south, north east, north west, south east, south west).       	
			\item Can you name at least one situation of complex traffic that is connected to the sector you are working in, for each sector?
			
			\item How do you take the decision to split frequencies? Do you think that sometimes splitting earlier (or later) would make the traffic more fluid? How often, in your opinion, you don't choose the best moment for the splitting?
			
			\item How long in advance can you foresee that you will have a conflict between two (or more) aircraft on the taxiway in low (and high) traffic conditions? How do you realize it? On which criteria do you choose the priority? If you can, make some examples.
			
			\item Can you foresee in advance that you will have more than two aircraft conflicting in the same area? What do you do if you realize it? 
			
			\item How much in advance do you usually realize that you will have a peak of traffic? What kind of protecting actions do you take when you realize it?
			
			\item Can you make some examples of situations when you can't foresee a peak in the traffic? Is it caused by lack of information? What kind of information do you think that could be useful to make a better prediction?
			
			\item What are the situations in which you decide to give a partial clearance to the pilots in low traffic situations? And in high traffic situations?
			
			\item In high traffic hours, how do you decide the order of the messages you are going to exchange with pilots? If you can, make some examples.
			
			\item What do you do when you are not exchanging messages with the pilots or the other controllers? i.e. what are the decisions that you have to take that may impact the workload?
			
			\item Do you think that if the same situation occurs twice you would take the same decision in both cases?
			
			\item Could you make some examples of situations in which two GC could act differently?
			
			\item How often you have to deal with a pilot that doesn't know the airport?
			
			\item How much you think that pilots that don't know the airport impact on the workload?
			
			\item Did you notice if the pilots belonging to some specific companies do more requests than others? (change of runway, reminding that the slot is expiring...)
		\end{enumerate}
	
		\item Human-machine interaction:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Have there be an evolution in the automation of your job since when you became a ground controller?
			
			\item What automated systems do you use for your job?
			
    		\item In which part of your job you think that an automated support tool would be helpful?
    		
   			\item Which part of your job you think that could never be accomplished by an automated system?
		\end{enumerate}    
    
    \item Open question:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Could you describe us the most complex working experience you had and how you reacted?
    \end{enumerate}

	\end{itemize}
