Here is a set of questions to pose to ground controllers:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Personal information:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Age, gender, educational background.
            \item For how many years are you working at Roissy-CDG? Did you work on other airports? Is there any distinctive feature at Roissy-CDG? 
            \item Could you describe your working rhythm?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Ground controller's practices:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Is your workload constant? 
            \item What are the situations of high workload for you? For each of them, describe your strategy.
            \item What are your strategies during situations of low workload?
            \item What's the maximum number of aircraft you have to handle at the time?
            \item How do pilots take part in decisions? Do your decisions change according to pilots?
            \item From the data, it emerges that only for 55\% of departing flights to a same destination it is assigned the same runway more than 80\% of the time. For the other destinations, the runway is assigned following criteria that are different from the direction of the destination. What is the strategy of runway assignment, in case it doesn't depend on the direction of the destination?
            \item Why in your opinion isn't the ground controller job completely automated? How autonomous do you think you are?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Communication:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are the supervisor tasks? Do you exchange information with him during your work?
            \item How and how often does the communication with pilots take place during taxiing? What information do you exchange? What difficulties do you encounter during the communication with pilots? 
            \item How and how often does the communication with apron controllers take place? What information do you exchange?
            \item Do you communicate with the three other ground controllers during rush hours? What kind of information do you exchange?
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Available information:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Do you get the position of aircraft by seeing them or by radar detection?
            \item How long in advance can you foresee that you will have a conflict between two or more aircraft on the taxiway? How do you realize it? What do you do when it happens?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Open question:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Could you tell us the most tragic working experience you had?
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{enumerate}
\end{document}
