\section*{Jaufr√© suggestions}
There are two possible directions our project can take.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A solution that helps manage the flux of airport ground traffic, so a model of the entire airport that, thanks to the tuning of some key parameters, allows to optimize the taxi time averaged on the whole ensamble of aircrafts traveling on the airport platform and on a large period of time. The key parameters that we want to tune are not trivial ones (such as aircraft speed during taxiing), nor structural ones (such as the construction of another terminal), but operational parameters. We want in fact to identify the optimal strategy for pilots and ground controller to adopt for optimizing the traffic flux.
	\item A solution that forecasts the taxi time of the aircrafts crossing the airport case by case.
\end{enumerate}
A model for each one of the two cases is proposed. For the first case, an agent based model, that allows to integrate structural and human/organizational factors in the same simulation. For the second case, a classical Machine Learning model, that predicts taxi time starting from the large amount of data collected during landing, take off and taxi procedures in the last few years.

\section{Agent Based Model}	
The Agent Based Model we drew up is described below. 

The aircraft platform is modeled as a network whose nodes represent intersections between the taxi ways and the taxiways themselves are represented by links whose weight is the length of the road. \textbf{With additional datas (mainly those included in \textit{.che} files) we could model it more precisely by considering not only the length of the various roads but also the average speed of planes on them.} 

The agents of type \textit{aircraft} move along the taxiways, with a strategy decided partly by the agent of type \textit{ground controller}, that has a more general view of what's happening on the airport platform, and partly by the agent of type \textit{pilot}. Thanks to the tuning of pilot and ground controller strategies we expect to find the optimal one, and to compare it with the actual behavior of the pilots and the ground controllers to see if it fits or what can be improved.

Eventual delays caused by external factors such as weather, delay at the take off airport for incoming flights... can be introduced as random noise in the time of aircraft's movement.
\subsection{Required Data}
The data required to implement this model are the following.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data about airport architecture: in particular data concerning taxiway and runways length.
	\item Data about the schedule of flights to be able to compute the total delay of the flights.
	\item All the data that correspond to the non-visual information available to ground controllers and to pilots that guide them in building their movement strategy.
	\item Clarifications about standard procedures adopted by ground controllers and pilots.
	\item Data that can explain the eventual difference in strategy in front of the same situation, i.e. personal strategy of each pilot/ground controller when the standard procedure is not applicable.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Collecting data}
For what it concerns the last type of data listed above, it is possible to collect information about personal strategies of pilots and ground controllers thanks to surveys conducted via phone calls.
\subsection{Added value of our project}
The great advantage of an agent based model of this kind is its refinement, since it includes a detailed simulation of the taxiway and of the procedures needed for an aircraft to land and take off.

Moreover, not only it identify the causes of the eventual delay of the flights (the flights are late because the airport capacity is exceeded/ the speed of aircraft is too low/ the weather is bad...), but it also offers a solution from an operational and strategical point of view.

This can happen thanks to the integration in one only model of the structural (taxiway modeling as a network) and human/operational factors(strategy modeling).
\section{Classical Machine Learning Model}
-relatively simple

\subsection{Required data}
-the data we use to make the prediction depend on which is the phase in which they will use it: we must feed the machine learning model with the data available at that time (it might be necessary to build a real time environment to transfer the data on our program).
